-----------------------------------javascript concept--------------------------------------

               note :- there should be no global variables(generally except constant)

              1) in javascript --- everything is an object----
              2) javascripting is a prototyping language.
              3) in javascript, you can edit created object properties
                 because everthing is a child of Object() which have a property __proto

              4) to preserve variable state between function use ..

                 ---------Concurrency---------

                 synchronous.... sequential

                 in javacript, function calls are syncronous but function execution is asynchronous.
                  javascript is not just a client side language, it is a server side
                1) nodeJS is a framework...
                2) nodeJs is single threaded


             ----------callbacks are functions passed as parameter------------

             javascript ---- the good parts
